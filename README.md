# iView

The project is based on a simple idea : convert everything that a human sees in front of him to words, so that even the vision impaired people can be aware of their surroundings. This will be implemented as a low cost alternative to expensive dedicated glasses or other devices, as a mobile application, that can run on any Android/IOS device. Also, we think that we can use the findings from this project in order to further improve the robots computer vision, to make them aware of what is around them. The project also implements a lot of new technologies such as Flutter and Firebase ML
